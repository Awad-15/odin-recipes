        <li><p>½ cup chopped onion</p></li>

        <li><p>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</p></li>
        <li><p>1 (15 ounce) can chili beans</p></li>
        <li><p>1 (1.25 ounce) package chili seasoning mix</p></li>
        <li><p>1 cup low-sodium chicken broth</p></li>
        <li><p>¼ cup butter</p></li>
        <li><p>4 cups milk</p></li>
        <li><p>1 cup buttermilk</p></li>
        <li><p>1 teaspoon salt</p></li>
        <li><p>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</p></li>
        <li><p>1 ½ cups shredded white Cheddar cheese</p></li>
        <li><p>½ cup sour cream</p></li>
        <li><p>chopped fresh chives (Optional)</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Prick potatoes with a fork. Transfer to a 10x15-inch baking pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, turning once, until tender, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, for chili, add ground beef, onion, and garlic to a large saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring to break up lumps, until meat is browned and onion is tender, about 10 minutes. Drain grease.</li>
        <li>Add tomato sauce, chili beans, and chili seasoning mix to saucepan. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, at least 10 minutes to let flavors meld.</li>
        <li>When potatoes are cool enough to handle, use a spoon to scoop potato pulp into large bowl. (You should have about 4 cups pulp). Discard skins. Add broth to bowl. Mash potatoes until smooth.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a 4- to 5-quart Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in flour and cook, whisking constantly to make a light roux, about 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in milk, 1 cup at a time. Cook, whisking constantly, until lightly thickened. Stir in potato mixture, buttermilk, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes (soup will be very thick). Remove from heat and gradually stir in 1 cup cheese.</li>
        <li>Divide soup among bowls. Top with chili, sour cream, remaining 1/2 cup cheese, and chives (if using).</li>
    </ol>
